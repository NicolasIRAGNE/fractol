.SH NAME
fractol \- displays fractals
.SH SYNOPSIS
fractol [FRACTAL] 
.PP
Current supported fractals are mandelbrot, julia and square.
.SH DESCRIPTION
fractol is a simple software used to display common fractals with the minilibx graphics lib.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c [color]"
Sets the color of the fractal to the one specified. Colors available = red, blue, green and chelou.
.IP "--dx [>0]"
Sets the program to render only 1/dx pixel horizontally. Can greatly speed up the rendering. Also gives a cool retro gameboy-like effect. If the value provided is negative or zero, it is set to 1.
.IP "--dy [>0]"
Same as --dx but vertically.
.IP "-f"
If either dx or dy is specified, will fill the black pixels with pixels of the same color. Speeds up the rendering at the cost of precision.
.IP "-m [>0]"
Sets the initial color multiplier.
.IP "-x [1-2560]"
Sets the horizontal dimensions of the window. If the value provided is negative or, it is set to 100.
.IP "-y [1-1440]"
Same as -x but vertical.
.IP "-i [1-255]"
Sets the initial iterations for the fractals, or the minimum size of the squares for the square fractal.
.IP "-e"
Sets the epileptic mode. Color changes everytime the mouse is moved.
.IP "-C"
Sets the 'chelou' mode on. Kinda psychedelic. Very cool.
.IP "-h"
Displays help.
.IP "-steak"
euh sa sa fe rien
.SH KEY BINDINGS
.IP "O"
Decreases iterations by 1.
.IP "P"
Increases iterations by 1.
.IP "K"
Decreases the color multiplier by 1.
.IP "L"
Increases the color multiplier by 1.
.IP "S"
If using julia, stops the mouse from changing the fractal. Pressing it again enables it back.
.IP "D"
Unsets the epileptic mode.
.IP "F"
Sets or unsets the chelou mode.
.IP "Arrow keys"
Moves the fractal in cardinal directions.
.IP "Mouse1 or Mwheelup"
Zooms in the fractal where the cursor is.
.IP "Mouse2 or Mwheeldown"
Dezooms.
.SH LONG FORMAT
Longer versions of the options for the sake of clarity.
.IP "--chelou"
Same as -C.
.IP "--help"
Same as -h.
.IP "--fill"
Same as -f.
